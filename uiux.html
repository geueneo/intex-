            <h1>User Experience </h1>
            <p>
                "User experience" encompasses all aspects of the end-user's interaction with
the company, its services, and its products. The first requirement for an
exemplary user experience is to meet the exact needs of the customer,
without fuss or bother. Next comes simplicity and elegance that produce
products that are a joy to own, a joy to use. True user experience goes far
beyond giving customers what they say they want, or providing checklist
features. In order to achieve high-quality user experience in a company's
offerings there must be a seamless merging of the services of multiple
disciplines, including engineering, marketing, graphical and industrial design,
and interface design.

               <h1>User Interface  </h1>
                				
				<br>A user interface is the system by which people (users) interact with a machine. The
user interface includes hardware (physical) and software (logical) components. User
interfaces exist for various systems, and provide a means of:
Input- allowing the users to manipulate a system (i.e using it)
Output- allowing the system to indicate the effects of the users' manipulation.
